To create addons, don't modify any already created .py files, you can use them for reference of variables.
You have to create a new py file which has a class and make sure you create a run() method which
has the main code to run
If you need other .py files, then you can create a folder with all the .py files including the main file.
Make sure you create a folder even if you only need one .py file. The main .py file should be called main.py.
You can use the base variable to access all the variables in the main class.
