# Thanks
Special thanks to <a href="https://discourse.panda3d.org/u/panda3dmastercoder"> panda3dmastercoder </a>.
He was the first to help me with development and created this repository.
Thank you <a href="https://discourse.panda3d.org/u/wezu"> wezu </a> for the wonderful DirectGUIDesigner program.
I used it to create a menu.
Thanks also <a href="https://discourse.panda3d.org/u/et1337"> et1337 </a> (<a href="https://github.com/etodd"> ettod </a>) for games a3p.
From there I took the planet model and menu system. Unfortunately, at the moment a3p is going through a difficult time. You can [support](https://github.com/etodd/a3p) this project. Never mind that the last commit was in 2012. Yes, this is a very old game, but you can still play it by downloading it from the [official game site](http://a3p.sf.net/)
