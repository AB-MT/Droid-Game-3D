Addon Loading is simple. Just put a the addon folder in the addons folder
Then open the addon folder and open main.py file and look for the main class.
After that open addon_config.json and add a new entry as follows.
"addon name (must match the name of the addon folder)": {"disabled": false/true, "main_class": "main class name"}.
You can enable and disable addons whenever needed.
Then, run the game as normal.
